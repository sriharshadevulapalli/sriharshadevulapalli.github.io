### Scraping and Cleaning US Judicial Data

The ultimate goal of this project is to build a database of federal judgeships across the 96 District courts in the United States. 

We assemble the following the following datasets
* Current vacancies from the US courts [website](https://www.uscourts.gov/judges-judgeships/judicial-vacancies/current-judicial-vacancies)
* Recent confirmations also from the US courts [website](http://www.uscourts.gov/judges-judgeships/judicial-vacancies/confirmation-listing)
* The [senate judiciary questionnaires](https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/hearings?PageNum_rs=1&type=Nomination&month=0&year=0) for these nominees. These PDFs are then converted to text so we can scavenge for useful data within these files. These files were too large to be uploaded to github, but if you would like the Senate Judiciary Questionnaire PDFs, please email to sriharsha.d@columbia.edu 

This data was then put together into a database so users could take a look at a judicial district map of the US that would showcase if a district had vacancies, who were the recent confirmations and nominations from that district and some biodata about them. The map can be viewed by clicking on "map.html".

*This was a Final Project submission for the Data and Databases Class in the Fall of 2021.
