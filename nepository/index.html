<p> By Sriharsha Devulapalli</p> 
<div id = "story">
    <p> Bollywood is often accused of being a nepotistic industry. Several leading actors in the current generation have had a leg up thanks to their parents or grand parents. We're not talking about the Kapoors or the Khans. Many other actors often have a connection or two that you might not know. </p>
    <p> For example, did you know Kajol's great grand mother was an actress? or that the Kapoors and Bacchans are related? Use the explorer to see how Bollywood's famous film families are related to each other.</p>
