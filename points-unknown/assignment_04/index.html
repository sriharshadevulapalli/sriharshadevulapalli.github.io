        <h2>The World Justice Rule of Law : 2021 </h2>
        <p> A quick analysis of how countries adherence to law has changed over the past six years</p>
        <p>The Rule of Law is a major upholding principle for Democracies. In the last few years, it has been on the decline, shows data from the World Justice Project. These declines were strongest in the Middle East and North Africa, South Asia, and European Union regions. In 2021, several governments across the world used the coronavirus pandemic to curtail freedoms. Venezuela was the lowest ranked country on the index along with Cambodia and Egypt. Denmark, Norway, Finland, and Sweden were the highest ranked countries in the list. </p>
        <p>This study conducted by the World Justice Project, an international civil society organization, surveyed over 38,000 households and 4,200 legal practitioners across 139 countries and measured this index based across eight factors : constraints on government powers, absence of corruption, open governance, adherence to fundamental rights, order and security, regulatory environment, access to civil justice, and criminal justice. 
        </p><p>If one takes a look at how the countryâ€™s rankings have changed since 2015 (the first comparable year), there appear to be concerning trends. Countries were classified into six categories based on how things have changed since then : Massive Decline, Decline, Slight Decline, Steady, Slight Increase, and Increase.
